    Vicious Cycles is a local store for bikers. These can be casual bikes, mountain bikes, high-performance tricked-out BMX bikes, etc. Alternately, these can be Harley Davidson, an American Eagle, mopeds, scooters, Kawasaki’s, or even concept vehicles. The choice of item is up to you. What brands do you want to sell? Or be a dealer for? Vicious also sells accessories.</p>

<p>Our Philosophy

Our philosophy is that when you choose your bike, you should choose it based on the folks who will not only build your bicycle, but also those who will help you get comfortable on the bike, as well as provide service down the road as you need it.
The best things in life are pretty simple. Riding bikes with friends, discovering new places and finding new trails are definitely included. Riding bikes helps us to disconnect from the hectic and noisy world and connect with friends, nature and ourselves. It might just be the best thing ever.
Technological advancement, digital exploration and the growing globalization defines the world we live in and will bring more change in the years to come than ever before. It’s a world full of uncertainties where it’s easy to get lost. But bikes are a very rare breed of products that are completely mechanical and analogue. There aren’t many products that are so simple yet so sophisticated in their designs. Maybe that is what started my excitement for bikes as products. The process of observing, designing, improving, engineering and producing bikes surely is the second-best thing ever.</p>

<p>Owner Bio

After spending my whole life on pedals, finishing my degree in mechanical engineering and working for two large companies making bikes I decided to change my priorities in life. I’ve never been good at sitting in an office waiting for Friday to come so, decided to start being self-employed. While I started off with engineering projects for companies in the bike industry, I also began to make notes and write down ideas for the bike I would make myself. I soon felt that my excitement wasn’t going to get any less and decided to explore the road of what has now become Vicious!

     <h2>About us</h2>
     <!--Step3.3-->
<p>Vicious Cycles Inc is a (your town)-based cycle workshop founded by a few like-minded individuals in late 2010. Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends to the day-to-day operations. We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast.
We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism. We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.
You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you ride again. It’s a Vicious Cycle! So make it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live your life.</p>

<p>Customer service and satisfaction

At Vicious Cycles, we are committed to providing superior customer service and satisfaction. Our staff will assist you every step of the way, from product selection and ordering to truly custom builds. We’ve been doing this whole custom thing for quite a while, and we've seen some ups and downs, we're loving every moment of it. A proper custom build takes time, and we’ll work closely with you to get it right. From stylish cycles to trusty monster rides, we’ve done them all. Talk with a member of our mechanic's team to discuss your plan, and we'll see your dream realized.</p>

<p>Safety: How can I buy from Vicious Cycles?

Vicious Cycle products can be purchased/ordered at our store. Come down today and we'll get started with a purchase of an existing bike with cash, credit, or in-house loan approval.
All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before projects will begin, and either payment in full, or an approved in-house loan, or a transfer of funds to a third-party vendor. All purchases on custom cycles are fina</p>

<p>Rugged: Trade shows

We exhibit at several trade shows every year.  We are at home in the indoor showroom, but we believe the real showroom can only be found out on and off the road. Cycling is a lifestyle- Live Your Life</p>

<p>Warranty: Every part of the LSM400 has a lifetime guarantee. We will replace
   or repair anything that goes wrong.</p>
